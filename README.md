# HalloweenParkour

Coded in 2 days for a minecraft event

This plugin was coded to fit our use case and is not very flexible, I would not reccomend using this as a plugin for your parkour event without heavily modifying it.

Due to the time limit I had creating this it would have been very challenging to build this plugin in a scaleable manner, perhaps in the future I will revisit this making it more general purpose
